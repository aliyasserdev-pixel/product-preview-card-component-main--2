### 💡 What I Learned

During this project, I practiced using *flexbox and grid layouts* to create a responsive product card.  
I also learned how to use *Google Fonts* effectively and how to *deploy a site on GitHub Pages*.

Example CSS snippet:
```css
button {
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 12px 100px;
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 10px;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(158, 42%, 18%);
}
